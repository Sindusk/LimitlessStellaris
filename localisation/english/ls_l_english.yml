  ls_dynamic_difficulty_desc: "The Dynamic Difficulty system for Limitless Stellaris will apply buffs to AI when they start falling behind. AI who are inferior or worse will start getting bonuses to economy and technology gain to help them catch up. This is done for each AI empire individually. The buff is very small but has infinite stages, allowing it to slowly nudge an AI into being a competitor. Once the AI has become more competitive, the buff begins to remove itself slowly to allow the AI to adapt naturally.\nThe target for dynamic difficulty is roughly §Ginferior§! level."
